# Build a Smart Task Manager  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Your challenge is to **design and develop a fully functional Task Management System** inspired by the reference images:  

- **Task Manager UI** ![image](./TaskManager.png)  
- **Timelines Dashboard** ![image](./Members_Dashboard.png)  

This application should allow users to:  
✅ **Create, edit, and manage tasks** with a **modal window**.  
✅ **Track task timelines** in an interactive dashboard.  
✅ **Filter, sort, and search** through a **large dataset** efficiently.  
✅ Ensure **seamless user experience** with a **modern, responsive UI**.  

💡 **Bonus:** Bring your **creativity** to add **unique and valuable features**!

🔹 **Drag & Drop (useRef)**: Allow users to **reorder** tasks in the list via **drag & drop**.  
🔹 **Modal Window**:  
   - Used for **adding and editing tasks**.  
   - Should close on **Escape key** and **outside click**.  

💡 **Bonus Features:**  
⭐ **Map Data Efficiently** – Store task data using a **map structure**, with **email ID as the key**.  
⭐ **Optimized Rendering** – Use **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`** to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
